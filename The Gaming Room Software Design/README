  The Gaming Room is a client that's requiring a game similar to "Draw It or Lose It" to be created for more compatible devices and not just Android, like the game mentioned prior. Their purpose is to have several teams competing for 4 rounds with each round having 1 minute to guess what images are being drawn before time runs out.
  My software design contains a Table of Contents with precise labeling and page numbers, specific and up-to-date Document Revision History, a detailed Executive Summary, Design Contraints pertaining to the client's exact needs and requirements, a Domain Model, a precise Evaluation chart, and Recommendations to the client.
  Working through this design document helped create a clear roadmap for the code, which made it easier to develop in a more clear and concise way than I would've if there were no design document. It also helped me to retain boundaries based on the client's requirements.
  If I had to pick one part of my work on this design document to revise, it would be on the Design Contraints. I would improve it by adding more details to each points, but without adding any extra points that might overwhelm the client. The idea is to be helpful and provide clear information to the client without it being too much.
  The client's needs were constantly kept at the forefront of this design document throughout it's creation. It's very important to keep this at the top of the list of importance because if even one small requirement is left out, the entire project can fall apart.
  I approached designing software by taking it one step at a time. It's easy to look at the broad spectrum of things and get overwhelmed and not know where to start, which can commonly cause a roadblock, therefore leading to delays. Finding the most important point and starting there, then going to the next step after that, keeps the mind clear and easier to please and keep calm.
